== PROJECT: Drink I/O


== Overview
As part of a NUS Software Engineering project, my group and I built *[blue]#_Drink I/O_#*,
a *one-stop, comprehensive inventory manager* for small drink distribution companies.
*[blue]#_Drink I/O_#* enables these companies to *keep track of their inventory* and
*analyse their sales performance*, and hence increase their productivity.

*[blue]#_Drink I/O_#* is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI), with a Graphic User Interface (GUI)
to make it easier for users to interact with the app. It is written in Java, and has about 10kLoC.

This project portfolio documents my contributions to the project, in particular the major feature I made:
the sales performance analyser feature.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major feature implemented*: Feature to *analyse cost, revenue and profit* over specific time periods
** _What it does_: Allows the user to calculate the overall cost, revenue and profit of the company
over based on its transactions. The statistics can be calculated over the time periods of:
a day, the past 7 days (including the current day), the past 30 days (including the current day).
** _Justification_: This feature enables the accountants in a small company to calculate the company's sales performance quickly.
It also allows the company to keep track of its finances simultaneously with its inventory.
** _Highlights_: This feature required the building of new classes to record the transactions: a `Transaction` class, and a `TransactionList` class to hold the `Transaction` s.
The optimisation of the code using `Predicate` s to filter the list of transactions by date challenged me to utilise

* *Other contributions*:
** *Morphing of existing model*:
*** The original code base is for an address book. Hence, the fundamental model used has to be changed to suit
*[blue]#_Drink I/O_#*. I morphed the model from that of a `Person` to a `Drink`, and created the relevant `Drink` attributes, such as `Price`.
*** Commands to buy and sell drinks did not exist in the original code base, but are necessary for an app for a drink distribution company.
 I implemented the `buy` and `sell` commands, which required an in-depth understanding of how the `Model` and `Logic` components worked.
** *Minor feature implemented*: Feature to *edit* the details of a drink in the inventory
*** This enables the user to edit the cost price, selling price and tags of a drink.
** Project management:
*** Managed releases for *[blue]#_Drink I/O_#*: `v1.2` and `v1.3` on GitHub

| This section showcases my contribution to the User Guide in relation to the sales performance analysis feature.
The performance statistics that can be calculated are cost, revenue and profit, and they can be computed over specific time periods.
