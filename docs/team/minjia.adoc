== PROJECT: Drink I/O


== Overview
As part of a NUS Software Engineering project, my group and I built *[blue]#_Drink I/O_#*,
a *one-stop, comprehensive inventory manager* for small drink distribution companies.
*[blue]#_Drink I/O_#* enables these companies to *keep track of their inventory* and
*analyse their sales performance*, and aims to increase their productivity.

*[blue]#_Drink I/O_#* is optimised for Command Line Interface (CLI), with a Graphic User Interface (GUI)
to make it easier for users to interact with the app. It is written in Java, and has about 10kLoC.

This project portfolio documents my contributions to the project, in particular the major enhancement I made:
the sales performance analyser feature.
